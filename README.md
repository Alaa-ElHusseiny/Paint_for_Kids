fancy coloring application for kids

1- applied advanced OOP using C++ language to create an interactive application for kids.

2- implemented an interactive GUI interface framework to make it fun and easy to use for kids.

3- The application has 2 main modes: Draw mode and play mode.

4- The kid can start with the draw mode by adding shapes such as (triangles, circles, rectangles, squares, and hexagons) with chosen dimensions.

5- The draw mode has many features such as coloring a selected figure or its outline, moving a figure, undoing, redoing, clearing all, deleting a figure, recording and displaying a record, and saving the draw screen.

6- The play mode challenges the kid with 3 games.

  a) The first game challenges the kid to choose all shapes of a specific type e.g. choose all circles.
  
  b) The second game challenges the kid to choose all shapes of a specific color e.g. choose all red shapes. 
  
  c) The final game challenges the kid to choose all shapes of a specific type and color e.g. choose all green hexagons.
  
  At the end of each game, the score of the kid is displayed.
